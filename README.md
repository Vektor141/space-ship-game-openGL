# space-ship-game-openGL
### The idea was to make something like Gradius, but that's **A LOT** of work, so I settled with just a ship traversing an asteroid field.

### Built with monogame and openGL using VS community.

### Things to do:
  * Turn the state system into something reusable
  * Make a better physics logic (it is :fire: garbage rn)
  * Make intro and outro scene
  * Make states for the asteroid field (rn it's just a lot of rocks going left)
